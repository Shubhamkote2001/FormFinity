Problem Statement:

Assume that you are the CTO for the outsourcing firm which has been chosen to build an
admission form for the Yoga Classes which happen every month.
Requirements for the admission form are:
- Only people within the age limit of 18-65 can enroll for the monthly classes and they will
be paying the fees on a month on month basis. I.e. an individual will have to pay the fees
every month and he can pay it any time of the month.
- They can enroll any day but they will have to pay for the entire month. The monthly fee is
500/- Rs INR.
- There are a total of 4 batches a day namely 6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM and 5-6PM. The
participants can choose any batch in a month and can move to any other batch next
month. I.e. participants can shift from one batch to another in different months but in
same month they need to be in same batch.

Explanation For Above Problem Statement: 

This problem statement is regarding the development of an admission form for yoga classes that happen every month.
This form will require users to provide some details before enrolling in the classes. The requirements for this form
are that the user must fall within the age limit of 18-65 and should be willing to pay the monthly fee of 500 INR for the classes. 

The users can enroll in any day of the month, but they have to pay the entire monthâ€™s fee upfront. 
There are four batches available everyday: 6-7AM, 7-8AM, 8-9AM and 5-6PM. The users can choose any batch in a month, 
and can move to any other batch in subsequent months. This means they can shift from one batch to another in different months,
but they need to stay in the same batch in the same month. 

To meet the requirements of this problem statement, the CTO of the outsourcing firm needs to develop an admission form that allows the users 
to provide their details and select the batch they want to join. The form should also be able to verify whether the user falls within the age 
limit or not and should be able to accept the payments.

The admission form should be designed in such a way that it is user-friendly and easy to use. 
The form should be able to provide clear instructions to the users, and should be able to guide them through the process. 
The form should also be secured, so that the data of the users is protected. 

Apart from the form, the CTO should also develop a system that can track the payments and ensure that the users are paying the monthly 
fee on time. This system should also be able to keep track of the users in each batch, so that the users can be moved to a different batch 
in the subsequent months. 

The CTO should also ensure that the form and the system are properly tested and debugged, 
so that they are free from any bugs and errors. The CTO should also ensure that the form and the system are regularly updated, 
so that any changes or improvements can be made. 

Overall, the CTO needs to develop an admission form and a tracking system that meets the requirements of this problem statement.
The form should be user-friendly and secure, and the system should be able to track the payments and the batches of the users. 
The form and the system should also be tested and debugged, and should be regularly updated.
